Command Runner Applet
=====================

A panel applet which periodically runs a command and displays its output.


How does it work
----------------

You add the applet to your panel the usual way: right-click, select "add to
panel" and select the Command Runner applet. Once it starts, it loads its
configuration and periodically runs a shell command, displaying its result in a
simple text label on the panel, pausing for 5 seconds between the command
invocations.

The command which is run is configurable via a little 'Preferences' dialog
accessible by right-clicking the applet. There is also an 'About' dialog.
The default command is "echo 'Hello.'"


What is it good for?
--------------------

I deveped it to be able to keep an eye on the size of the mail queue on my
laptop, to avoid the problem where a misconfiguration I introduced would stop
any mail from being sent from my system.
